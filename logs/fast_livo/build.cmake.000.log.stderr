[31m[1mCMake Error[0m at /home/aa-04/Smart_Eye_Lidar_Cam/src/FAST-LIVO2/CMakeLists.txt:103 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindPDAL.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "PDAL", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "PDAL" with any of
  the following names:

    PDALConfig.cmake
    pdal-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "PDAL" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "PDAL_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "PDAL"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
